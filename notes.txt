Rules for Meta data

Default QueryContext filter:
- Anonymous user
- No Collection specified
- Hide Hidden
- Only show published items or items with no Meta data
- Culture is set, by default to US, hard coded ( ensure culture method )
- By default, no culture fallbakcs

Results with Default Meta ( Meta.Empty ):
- Included in all culture contexts, both with and without fallbacks filter
- If access empty, then fallback to type default which is either anonymous or admin

New content:
When no Meta Data is specified, leave as null

MetaData can only be changed by Revision Actions

MetaData for NodeData can be null, "empty", "min", or "full"
MetaData for NodeDataRevision is always "full", and is never null
MetaData for NodeDataRevisions is NA, and we use MetaData of first revision
